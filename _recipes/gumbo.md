tags: dinner, seafood, cajun, rice

ingredients:
- Meat
    - 1 lb smoked sausage
    - 1 lb andouille sausage
    - 2.5 lbs boneless skinless ahicken thighs
- Veggies
    - 1 large diced yellow onion
    - 2 diced green peppers
    - 4 to 6 stalks of chopped celery
    - 4 to 6 cloves of garlic
    - add chopped spicy peppers if desired
- Seasoning mix
    - 2 tbsp chicken bullion
    - 1 tbsp kosher salt
    - 1 tbsp oregano
    - 2 tsp cayenne
    - 1 tsp garlic powder
    - 1 tsp onion powder
    - 1 sprinkle of thyme
    - 1 tsp paprika 
    - crack black pepper until your wrist hurts
    - Also have a container of "Tonys Creole Seasoning"
    - 2 bay leaves
- Liquids
    - 2-ish tbsp (eyeball it) Louisiana hot sauce
    - 2 tbsp Zatarans Liquid Shrimp and Crab Boil
    - 32 oz chicken broth
    - 16 oz water
    - 1 12 oz beer of choice (IPA or Lager works great)
- Garnish
    - chopped green onion
    - ground sasafrass leaves, aka Gumbo File
- Roux
    - You will want to start with whatever fat is left in the pot
    - Add vegetable oil if needed to fully coat bottom of pot
    - Wait for oil to come to temperature, want it slightly hot
    - Have onions, peppers, celery, garlic, and spicy peppers prepared
        - Have onions by themselves, then celery and green peppers in another group, and last garlic.
    - Have chicken stock nearby (not chilled, want it pantry/room temp)
    - Have seasoning mix pre-portioned and ready to add to vegetables
    - Have beer by your side
    - Start adding flour to oil. You want the consistency to be near to caramel, almost wet sand.
    - Using a flat bottomed wooden spoon, stir constantly. Do not walk away.
    - you will need to keep the heat to a medium to medium low, depending on how things smell and develop
    - stir constantly, ensuring to pull roux off the bottom of the pan as you go
    - You want a dark brown/caramel color, nutty smelling. 
    - This will go as fast or as slow as you set the heat to. 
        If you burn the roux, you must throw it out. The taste is unbearable. Better to start over than to ruin the gumbo.
    - Once roux is near chocolate or dark brown caramel, add onions.
    - Recipe will contiue in directions. Potentially will break this out using the components feature of Chowdown in the future.


directions:
- Save your energy. Long before cooking begins, prep everything out.
    - coin size chop the sausages, set aside into one bowl.

- Begin
    - In a large stainless steel stew/gumbo pot, coat bottom with oil, brown sausages in batches, and set aside. Season with Tonys as you go. 
        - I usually have a bowl with a strainer inside to store them while the rest are cooking
    - Using sausage fat and additional oil if needed, begin Roux process
    - Once roux is complete, add onions and stir vigourously. Onions should be room temp so as to not clump roux.
    - Once onions start to tenderize, add celery and green pepper.
    - If roux is beginning to clump/stick to the bottom of the pan, use a splash of chicken broth (room temp) and stir vigourously to incorporate
    - Add garlic and spicy peppers here
    - Add seasoning blend
    - Once veggies are tender and fragrant with seasonings after toasting for a bit, slowly begin streaming in chicken broth while stirring vigourously
    - One broth is completely added, allow to come to a simmer, continuing to stir.
    - Once steaming, add sausages, beer, Liquid Crab Boil, louisiana hot sauce
    - When low boiling, add whole boneless skinless chicken thighs
    - Simmer covered for 90 to 120 minutes, stirring every 20 to 30 minutes, keeping at a low boil (med-low heat, towards the lower side. slightly burbling)
    - Serve over white rice, garnish with File and green onions.
