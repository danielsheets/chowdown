    - 1 lb smoked sausage
    - 1 lb andouille sausage
    - 2.5 lbs boneless skinless ahicken thighs
- Veggies
    - 1 large diced yellow onion
    - 2 diced green peppers
    - 4 to 6 stalks of chopped celery
    - 4 to 6 cloves of garlic
    - add chopped spicy peppers if desired
- Liquids
    - 2-ish tbsp (eyeball it) Louisiana hot sauce
    - 2 tbsp Zatarans Liquid Shrimp and Crab Boil
    - 32 oz chicken broth
    - 16 oz water
    - 1 12 oz beer of choice (IPA or Lager works great)
- Garnish
    - chopped green onion
    - ground sasafrass leaves, aka Gumbo File
    - french bread slices


directions:
- Save your energy. Long before cooking begins, prep everything out.
    - coin size chop the sausages, set aside into one bowl.
    - leave chicken thighs whole
    - dice onion
    - dice green pepper
    - smash/dice garlic (or pre-jarred diced is fine)
    - also dice up any additional spicy peppers if desired
    - portion out seasonings into a single prep container, to be ready to be thrown in all at once.
- Begin
    - In a large stainless steel stew/gumbo pot, coat bottom with oil, brown sausages in batches, and set aside. Season with Tonys as you go. 
        - I usually have a bowl with a strainer inside to store them while the rest are cooking
    - Using sausage fat and additional oil if needed, begin Roux process
    - Once roux is complete, add onions and stir vigourously. Onions should be room temp so as to not clump roux.
    - Once onions start to tenderize, add celery and green pepper.
    - If roux is beginning to clump/stick to the bottom of the pan, use a splash of chicken broth (room temp) and stir vigourously to incorporate
    - Add garlic and spicy peppers here
    - Add seasoning blend
    - Once veggies are tender and fragrant with seasonings after toasting for a bit, slowly begin streaming in chicken broth while stirring vigourously
    - One broth is completely added, allow to come to a simmer, continuing to stir.
    - Once steaming, add sausages, beer, Liquid Crab Boil, louisiana hot sauce
    - When low boiling, add whole boneless skinless chicken thighs
    - Simmer covered for 90 to 120 minutes, stirring every 20 to 30 minutes, keeping at a low boil (med-low heat, towards the lower side. slightly burbling)
    - Serve over white rice, garnish with File and green onions.
