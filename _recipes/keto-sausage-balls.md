title: "Keto Sausage Balls"
tags: keto

ingredients:
- 1 tbsp chili powder
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 pound breakfast sausage
- 4 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 3 eggs, beaten
- 1 cup shredded cheddar
- 1/3 cup coconut flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
- Cook your breakfast sausage, drain off any excess fat, and set it aside to cool slightly.
- When the sausage has cooled, add it to a mixing bowl and combine with the cream cheese until there are no cream cheese clumps left. (It is important to make sure the sausage is not too hot before continuing, as it will cook the egg when you add it in the next step).
- Stir in the cheddar cheese, eggs, coconut flour, and baking powder.
- When the mixture is well incorporated, cover and chill in the fridge for 5-10 minutes. Coconut flour continues to absorb moisture, so if the dough feels too runny, this step will help. Skipping this step and not chilling the dough will result in flat bites, not balls like you see in the photos.
- Grease a baking sheet and using a small cooking scoop place the sausage, egg, and cheese bites on the tray.
- Bake 18-20 minutes.
