title: "Cajun Gumbo - Roux"

ingredients:
- hot pork fat and/or vegetable oil, around 1/4 cup.
- white flour
- wooden flat bottomed spoon

directions:
- Before beginning, have all seasoning, vegetables, meats, and deglazing liquid nearby within reach
- A roux is critical to the texture and flavor of a Gumbo. You want a dark caramel, almost chocolate nutty coloring and a not-quite wet sand slurry like texture.
- If you start smelling burning popcorn or any burnt notes, the roux is useless and must be disposed of.
- Lower temperatures will make this take 45 minutes to 1 hour
- Higher temperatures will make this go faster, however carries higher risk of burning yourself and/or the roux. Take extreme caution.
- After cooking sausage, add additional oil to ensure bottom is coated plus a little bit, and heat over medium heat.
- While stirring constantly, Add flour until a texture like "not-quite" wet sand is reached, and continue stirring.
- Continue stirring constantly until the slurry becomes dark brown, then add onions.
- To loosen texure once onions are cooked, stream in chicken stock slowly while stirring consantly.
- Do not add liquid too quickly to avoid clumpy roux.

The roux will come after cooking the sausauge coins, and following the roux reaching the right color and smell, the onions will go in first, then the vegetables and so on. See full Gumbo recipe for the rest.
